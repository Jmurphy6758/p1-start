Software Dependencies:
Requires access to Matplot, Pyplot, Numpy, and Sys.

How to use Program:
Only one set of data must be present per file. The data must start on row 33 and data 
should be separated by commas. Strain data must be in the eighth column and stress data must be in the fourth column.
The graph and data can be generated by the following line of code:
$ python plot.py [FILENAME]
Where FILENAME is the location and file name of the data being generated.

Example:
running
 $ python plot.py raw-data/aluminum 
will run the aluminum data in the raw-data folder. A copy of the graph will be saved in the same folder and Youngs Modulus will appear in the console. 

Problems:
There is a significant delay in between me typing and the console responding, most likely because I dont have great internet and am using the vpn to access BSU servers. This resulted in me trying to write all the code out with pencil before putting it in to the computer. It made the process easier for me, but I didnt get instant feedback if I did something wrong. 
I also had a hard time getting the graph to actually show up until I found out you need the plt.show() command in bash.
I definitely know more about what Im doing in bash, but I still feel like I only know how to half do things
